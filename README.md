# SQL-POWER-BI-Project---Bank-Loan-Report-

Project Overview:
This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into bank loan data using SQL for data extraction, transformation, and Power BI for visualization.
The goal is to derive actionable business intelligence that can help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, risk management, and customer segmentation.

Key Features
Data Extraction & Transformation:
1. SQL was used to create, manipulate, and manage the loan table containing detailed loan application information.
2. The data includes fields such as loan status, employment length, grade, home ownership and more which are critical for evaluating loan applications.

Data Visualization & Reporting:
1. Power BI was utilized to create interactive dashboards that present key metrics and trends in the loan data.
2. Visualizations include loan approval rates, default rates, distribution of loans across different grades and states and other relevant KPIs.

Business Analysis & Insights
1. Loan Performance: The project analyzes how different factors like employment length, loan grade, and home ownership status affect loan performance (approval, default, etc.).
2. Customer Segmentation: Insights into customer demographics and how they relate to loan approvals, allowing for targeted marketing and risk assessment strategies.
3. Risk Management: Identification of high-risk loan segments based on historical data, enabling proactive measures to mitigate potential defaults.

Data Analysis Details
SQL:
1. Created and managed tables to store and process loan data.
2. Used SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and analyze loan information.
3. Insights derived from SQL queries were directly fed into Power BI for visualization.

Power BI:
1. Created dynamic dashboards to visualize loan data trends over time.
2. Used charts to compare loan approval rates across different customer segments.
3. Provided drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis of specific loan applications.
